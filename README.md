# Exploring Data Augmentation Techniques for Text Classification

We investigate the use of **Data Augmentation (DA)** in improving the accuracy of text classification tasks. Using 6 datasets with different numbers of classification classes, and FastAIâ€™s implementation of **ULMFiT** as our model, we test the use of 8 data augmentation techniques in isolation and in combination, and investigate its effects on classification accuracy change. We find that in terms of performance, DA increases accuracy, but no clear technique is superior.
